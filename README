This is my little project. I am making a contact manager thing. 

My idea for this manager is that it's going to be a CLI contact manager. 

TODO:
- Fix the fgets() on the -n flag. Done
- Create functionality to delete specific contact. (-d)
- Create functionality to list specific contact (-l)
- Create functionality to list ALL contacts (-L) Done
- Create functionality to edit a specific contact (-E) or (-e)
- Fix eventual bugs. 
- Conduct some testing. Write test cases and then execute tests.
